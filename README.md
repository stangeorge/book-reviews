#### Lab Girl by Hope Jahren

I read this book and wanted to love science as Hope does. I wanted to be as tenacious as Bill is. I wanted to be a botanist. I wanted to be a tree hugger. This is an amazing read. Hope and Bill went through enough things to make this into a movie. Not only is truth stranger than fiction, it is also more fun.

The first thing that bubbles up is Hope's love for plants and science. She describes her struggles with mania. She requests for umpteen grants. I realize science is not easy. I heard her mention on NPR radio that she stretched every quarter to a dollar to make it last more. She felt humble being able to work on what she loved.

Bill is an unbelievable character. He starts off homeless. He lives, shaves and eats in a van. Then he is promoted to sleeping and living in the labs. He has dedicated his life to science. He is a true good hacker.

Its comical how they meet, how Hope offers Bill a job and how Bill accepts it. That begins an adventure that sounds like a movie plot. There is the amazing trip to iceland. They unsuccessfully bluff at airport customs.

Hope and Bill are an inspiration. Their loyalty is unparalleled. They remind me of my favorite fictional duo: Hari Seldon and Yugo Amaryl from the Foundation series science-fiction books. Seldon the scientist and Yugo the eternal workaholic.

This is a great book. It is an inspiration for anyone to become the best in whatever they are doing.

#### Foundation Trilogy by Isaac Asimov

Foundation is my first science-fiction book. And it blew me away. I am a huge fan of science-fiction movies but this is so much more. There is the usual advanced technology but the plot is thick. The characters are awesome and the twists are amazing. After reading this I just had to read the other two books: Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation.

The first book lays the ground work for psychohistory. This is the mathematics of predicting the future. The story starts off innocently enough with people writing an encyclopedia. Then Mayors such as Salvador Hardin show amazing political skill. This follows the age of the Traders such as Hober Mallow. This part feels like a Bond movie.

The second book pits the Foundation against the Galactic Empire. General Bel Riose seems unstoppable. The war tactics are witty. When it looks like nothing can stop the Foundation, along comes the Mule. And it gets exciting! The suspense is amazing and all seems lost.

The third book deals with the little known Second Foundation. They are almost a myth. First the Mule searches for them. Then the first Foundation searches for them.

Overall, this was completely satisfying. Asimov is young and impatient. He leaves a lot to the readers to figure out. This is different from the mature Asimov of the later books in the Foundation series. I love this young Asimov from the Foundation trilogy. It feels like many novels combined into each of these books.

#### The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway

This is my second Hemingway book. I was hooked after reading his The Old Man and the Sea. The book itself is fairly straightforward and describes the events surrounding Jake and Brett. Jake is a writer and Brett is a lady with a title.

The story starts off in France. There is a lot of eating, drinking and partying among the American expat community. Then they go to Spain for the bullfights and the event where bulls run through the streets chasing people. There is even more drinking.

Reading this book makes you want to drink all the cocktails Hemingway describes. Pernod and absinthe come up many times. It makes you want to do fishing, bullfighting and everything Hemingway describes. He is convincing and detailed. This book consumed me.

Overall this is a fun book to read. Never a dull moment. It felt like reading The Catcher in the Rye (1951) by J. D. Salinger. There is always something going on and there are a lot of conversations.

I recommend this book for its easy pace, simple language and a vivid description of places and events.
