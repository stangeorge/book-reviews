#### Lab Girl by Hope Jahren

I read this book and wanted to love science as Hope does. I wanted to be as tenacious as Bill is. I wanted to be a botanist. I wanted to be a tree hugger. This is an amazing read. Hope and Bill went through enough things to make this into a movie. Not only is truth stranger than fiction, it is also more fun.

The first thing that bubbles up is Hope's love for plants and science. She describes her struggles with mania. She requests for umpteen grants. I realize science is not easy. I heard her mention on NPR radio that she stretched every quarter to a dollar to make it last more. She felt humble being able to work on what she loved.

Bill is an unbelievable character. He starts off homeless. He lives, shaves and eats in a van. Then he is promoted to sleeping and living in the labs. He has dedicated his life to science. He is a true good hacker.

Its comical how they meet, how Hope offers Bill a job and how Bill accepts it. That begins an adventure that sounds like a movie plot. There is the amazing trip to iceland. They unsuccessfully bluff at airport customs.

Hope and Bill are an inspiration. Their loyalty is unparalleled. They remind me of my favorite fictional duo: Hari Seldon and Yugo Amaryl from the Foundation series science-fiction books. Seldon the scientist and Yugo the eternal workaholic.

This is a great book. It is an inspiration for anyone to become the best in whatever they are doing.

#### The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway

This is my second Hemingway book. I was hooked after reading his The Old Man and the Sea. The book itself is fairly straightforward and describes the events surrounding Jake and Brett. Jake is a writer and Brett is a lady with a title.

The story starts off in France. There is a lot of eating, drinking and partying among the American expat community. Then they go to Spain for the bullfights and the event where bulls run through the streets chasing people. There is even more drinking.

Reading this book makes you want to drink all the cocktails Hemingway describes. Pernod and absinthe come up many times. It makes you want to do fishing, bullfighting and everything Hemingway describes. He is convincing and detailed. This book consumed me.

Overall this is a fun book to read. Never a dull moment. It felt like reading The Catcher in the Rye (1951) by J. D. Salinger. There is always something going on and there are a lot of conversations.

I recommend this book for its easy pace, simple language and a vivid description of places and events.
